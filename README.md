First JS project - The Odin Project curriculum - Foundations

First JS project for the Odin Project curriculum. The logic was quite straightforward as I went through this challenge with Python already. Still a good way to get more confident with the syntax though.

The user interface addition was more challenging, but it was a nice way to get more familiar with DOM manipulation methods and events. It also gave me the opportunity to explore some new CSS concepts (transform, transition)
